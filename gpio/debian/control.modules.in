Description: gpio module for linux (kernel _KVERS_)
 This package contains the kernel module for the
 line of general purpose input/output (GPIO) data acquisition boards 
 made by MeasurementComputing (http://www.measurementcomputing.com).
 .
 The following boards are currently supported:
 .
    CIO-DIO24
    PCI-DIO24
    PCI-PDISO8
    PCI-PDISO16
    PCI-DAS1000 (Digital section only)
 .
 please see /usr/share/doc/gpio-module-_KVERS_ for details.
 .
 This package contains the compiled kernel module for _KVERS_
 .
 If you have compiled your own kernel, you will most likely need to build
 your own gpio-module.  The gpio-source package has been
 provided for use with the Debian kernel-package utility to produce a version
 of gpio-module for your kernel.
